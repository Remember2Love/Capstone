# Remember2Love

![Team](/Remember2Love/Images/Remember2LoveTeam.png)

In the simplest terms, Remember2Love is a digital assistant for older adults with dementia. Providing visual cues for recognizing loved ones, recalling memories, and tracking daily life, our solution prolongs autonomy, relieves anxiety and sustains social ties. Via video receipts, the patient's doctor and family are assured of medical and dietary adherence and of patient safety in their independence. We utilize Apple's ecosystem of Vision, coreML, createML and ARKit to make this a reality.
